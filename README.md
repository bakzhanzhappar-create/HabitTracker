# HabitTracker
HabitTracker — is my first GitHub project. Its purpose is to help track daily habits, the time spent on them, and their subjective importance.
This project aims to show not only what you did, but how meaningful each action was for you.

# For example:

“Today I read a book for 3 minutes, and I rate this habit as 8 out of 10.”

The tracker will automatically assign a unique ID and save it to habits.csv

# habits.csv
It will save it like that:
#### id,name,minutes,weight,date
#### 1,Reading,10,7,2025-01-03
#### 2,Workout,30,9,2025-01-03
#### 3,Reading,3,8,2025-6-11

You can also delete habits if needed — the tracker allows you to remove any entry by its ID.
This project is still do have need improvements, but it already provides a simple and clear way to record your daily progress as it purposed.

For now, HabitTracker is a clean and minimal tool that helps you build awareness of your habits — one small action at a time.
